How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    allows to compare different versions of a file so as to restore or correct a newer version which might crash

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: logical commits which can be easily used to understand where to correct something

    cons: you can forget to save your version and lose everything if there is a bug

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    when files are interdependant a change in 1 file can trigger changes in the others, so it's important to have each of 
    these versions to track down all errors

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    allows to see all the commits and to check the differences between each of them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always revert back to a previous version which worked
